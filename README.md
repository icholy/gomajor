### Warning:

* This tool does not understand `replace` directives or nested modules.
* By default, only cached content will be fetched from the module proxy (See `-cached` flag).
* If you have multiple major versions imported, **ALL** of them will be rewritten.
* The latest version will not be found if there are **gaps** between major version numbers.
* The `path` command does not rewrite package names.
* Modules matching `GOPRIVATE` are skipped.
